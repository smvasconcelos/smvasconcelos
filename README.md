👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate web developer with nearly 5 years of experience in web development.
In recent years, I've worked as a Full Stack Developer using PHP and Laravel, delivering and maintaining complex systems that serve critical business needs.

While Laravel and PHP have been my main backend stack recently, I’m currently diving deeper into the Node.js ecosystem, expanding my backend capabilities and aligning them with modern JavaScript-based architectures.

My current tech stack includes:

- ⚛️ React (TypeScript)
- 🔄 React Query
- 📋 React Hook Form
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS

And on the backend side, I’m studying and building projects with:

- 🐘 PHP - Laravel
- 🐘 MySQL
- 🟩 Node.js & NestJS
- 🛠️ Prisma ORM

🧠 Soft Skills & Business Experience

Over the years, I’ve:

- 🧩 Participated in complex business rule refinements, especially in large monolithic architectures
- 📌 Worked on critical system modules with high access volume, ensuring performance and reliability
- 🤝 Actively engaged in team rituals — daily scrums, sprint planning, and backlog refinements
- 🧠 Strengthened my product thinking, aligning technical solutions with business goals
- 🔄 Applied CI/CD practices to streamline delivery and improve deployment efficiency
