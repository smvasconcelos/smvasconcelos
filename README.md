### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate developer with nearly **5 years of experience in frontend development**. I began my career as a **full stack developer**, but over the years, I've focused on crafting rich user experiences using modern frontend technologies.

My current tech stack includes:

- ⚛️ **React (TypeScript)**
- 🔄 **React Query**
- 📋 **React Hook Form**
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**

I'm currently **diving deeper into backend development** again — reinforcing my skills with:

- 🟩 **Node.js** & **NestJS**
- 🛠️ **Prisma ORM**
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL**
- 🐘 **PHP - Laravel**
- 🐘 **Mysql**

### 🧠 Soft Skills & Business Experience

Over the years, I’ve:

- 🧩 Participated in **complex business rule refinements**, especially in large **monolithic architectures**
- 📌 Worked directly on the maintenance and evolution of a **critical system module** with high access volume, ensuring stability, performance, and alignment with business needs
- 🤝 Grown in **team rituals**: daily scrums, sprint planning, and backlog refinements
- 🧠 Developed a strong understanding of **product thinking**, always aligning development with business goals
- 🔄 Applied **CI/CD practices** to streamline delivery and reduce friction in deployment cycles

### 🌱 Learning Goals

I’m expanding my full stack capabilities to build scalable and robust applications from front to back. My focus now is to blend clean UI with solid backend architecture.
